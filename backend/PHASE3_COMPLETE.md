2. Progress over time graphs with timestamped responses
3. Difficulty distribution analysis across question categories
4. Time distribution analysis for response patterns
5. Overall statistics and metrics

### Comparative Analysis Engine
Detailed analysis comparing different career paths:
1. Top performing categories identification
2. Related career path recommendations
3. Strength identification through response pattern analysis
4. Areas for improvement suggestions
5. Personalized recommendations for education and skill development

## Development Practices

### Test-Driven Development
All core functionality developed with tests first:
1. Write failing tests before implementation
2. Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. Refactor for clarity and efficiency
4. Repeat for all functionality

### Modular Architecture
Clear separation of concerns:
1. **Models**: Data schema and validation
2. **Controllers**: Business logic implementation
3. **Routes**: API endpoint definitions
4. **Middleware**: Authentication and validation
5. **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities
6. **Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage

### Continuous Integration
Automated testing through GitHub Actions:
1. **Trigger**: On push/pull request to main branch
2. **Environment**: Node.js setup
3. **Steps**: Checkout, npm install, npm test
4. **Reporting**: Pass/fail status for all builds

## Impact Potential

The successful implementation of Phase 3 provides students with:

1. **Personalized Career Guidance**: AI-powered recommendations based on individual aptitudes and interests
2. **Informed Decision Making**: Data-driven insights for educational and career choices
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant interface for all users
4. **Scalability**: Cloud-native architecture for national deployment
5. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security for user data protection

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 complete, we are now ready to begin implementation of:
