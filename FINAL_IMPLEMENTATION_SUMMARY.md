## Development Practices
Our implementation follows industry best practices:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: All core functionality developed with tests first
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with component-based design
3. **Security First**: Password hashing, JWT authentication, and input validation
4. **Scalable Design**: Cloud-native architecture with horizontal scaling capabilities
5. **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG guidelines followed throughout development
6. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms and lazy loading where appropriate
7. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing through GitHub Actions
8. **Documentation**: Comprehensive code comments and system documentation

## Default Student Segments
The system automatically creates the following default segments:
1. **High Achievers** - Students with excellent academic performance and strong interest in competitive fields
2. **Creative Thinkers** - Students with interests in arts, literature, and creative fields
3. **Rural Students** - Students from rural areas who may need additional support
4. **Financial Need** - Students who may require financial assistance for higher education
5. **STEM Enthusiasts** - Students with strong interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics

## Classification Algorithm
The student classification algorithm calculates match scores based on:
- Academic performance (GPA range matching)
- Interest area overlap
- Geographic location matching
- Financial status matching

Each criterion contributes to an overall confidence score that determines the best matching segment for each student.
