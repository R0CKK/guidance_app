## Development Philosophy

Our approach emphasizes:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: All core functionality developed with tests first
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with component-based design
3. **Security First**: Password hashing, JWT authentication, and input validation
4. **Scalable Design**: Cloud-native architecture with horizontal scaling capabilities
5. **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG guidelines followed throughout development
6. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms and lazy loading where appropriate
7. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing through GitHub Actions

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Begin implementation of Phase 2 features (Extended User Registration)
2. **Short-term Goal**: Complete comprehensive user profile system with personal information collection
3. **Medium-term Goal**: Implement aptitude assessment quiz system
4. **Long-term Vision**: Achieve full national rollout through government schools and skill centers

## Impact Potential

The Digital Guidance Platform addresses a critical gap in India's education system by providing:

- **Improved enrollment** in government degree colleges through informed decision-making
- **Reduced dropouts** after Class 10 and 12 by empowering students with career clarity
- **Accessible guidance** to underserved communities who lack access to quality career counseling
