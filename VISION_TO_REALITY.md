# Digital Guidance Platform - Vision to Reality

## From Idea to Implementation

### Original Problem Statement
The decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not due to poor infrastructure or lack of teaching resources, but rather a critical gap in awareness. Students and their parents often don't understand:
- The importance of graduation
- Career opportunities different degree courses unlock
- How to choose a subject stream based on personal interest and future prospects

Students face confusion about:
- Which subject stream (Arts, Science, Commerce) to opt for
- What degree programs are available in nearby government colleges
- What jobs or higher studies they can pursue after choosing a course
- Whether pursuing graduation is worth the effort

### Our Solution Approach
